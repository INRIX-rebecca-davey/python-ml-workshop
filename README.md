# Installing stuff

## If you don't currently have Python installed

There are a couple of options...

You can install Python directly from https://www.python.org/downloads/, and then install the required packages separately (see below).

Or you can install everything via Anaconda, in one of two ways:
- install the 'full' Anaconda distribution (437MB), which includes everything we'll be using, but also lots of other packages we won't be using 
- install 'Miniconda' which is some essentials, including Python and conda, the tool used to install packages via Anaconda. This way you install just the packages we'll be using, but all from one place. Minconda: https://conda.io/miniconda.html

## If you already have Python installed

Zero'th option: use the soon-to-be environment.yml file to create a conda environment with all the libraries we'll be using!

If you installed Python via Anaconda but don't have the packages listed here, you can get them using the conda tool, with 'conda install PACKAGENAME'

If you installed Python directly:
- you could either get miniconda to install
- or you could use pip

## What is Anaconda/conda and how does conda work?

Anaconda is a distribution that includes Python and a whole host of useful packages and libraries, including all that we'll be using. Anaconda also includes 'conda', which is a command line tool for managing and installing new packages.
