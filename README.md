# Installing stuff

## If you don't currently have Python installed

There are a couple of options...

You can install Python directly, and then install the required packages separately

Or you can install everything via Anaconda, in one of two ways:
- install the 'full' Anaconda package, which includes everything we'll be using, but also lots of other packages we won't be using - SIZE?
- install 'Miniconda' which just includes Python and conda, the tool used to install packages via Anaconda. This way you install just the packages we'll be using, but all from one place.

## If you already have Python installed

You could...
- use conda to get the packages. Running Python and Anaconda side by side?
- use pip to get the packages
